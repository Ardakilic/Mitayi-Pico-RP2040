# Mitayi Pico

**Mitayi Pico** is the first development board from **CIRCUITSTATE Electronics**. It is a small development board based on the **RP2040** microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. The board is designed after the official Pico board from Raspberry Pi, but adds a few improvements over it.

The schematic and PCB are designed with **KiCad**, an open-source EDA tool. All the design files of Mitayi Pico are completely open-source and released under the MIT license.
